# Overview
The subject of this project is a small company which deals with the processing and manipulation of images. This company is considering transferring some of its business processes to the Web in the form of web services. As a part of feasibility study, I was asked to carry out prototyping activities to act as proof-of-concept for this transformation.
When an image is to be processed, a paper form is filled in by an expert from the company to specify what changes the image should undergo.

To demonstrate that it is feasible to use an XML document to capture image manipulation requests for the company, I was asked to create a sample XML document and an accompanying XML Schema instance. The XML document needed to contain some sample data illustrating that it could contain the same information as the request form. The XML Schema instance was needed to validate the XML document.
